- 👋 Hi, I’m @mobile44. When I was young, there was not university in my home town. Computer was just an item in the TV news or comic books.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science after I got a chance to develop a program for customer record filing. Now, I can manage Linux and Windows servers. A lot of old scripting languages such as Bash Shell, VBScript, PHP, Perl, HTML I had used to build different solutions for operation routines. But it is not a stop to me. Machine Learning is really fun as it juices up the scripting language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Hooks JSX and Django as I want to make machine learning easier for people to feel it from web browsers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work in an organization which is providing smart solutions to the market and I can turn my personal studies into practical applications.
- 📫 How to reach me? I am die hard Tims' friend. You may meet me there. ^.^
